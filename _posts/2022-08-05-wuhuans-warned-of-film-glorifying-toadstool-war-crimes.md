Experts are warning Wuhuans to be skeptical of the upcoming "Mario movie" produced by studios under the control of the Toadstool regime. While we have yet to see the contents of this production, at face value it can be assumed that this is a propaganda movie attempting to glorify the Toadstool General Mario Mario who led the invasion of LEGO City and continues his campaign in Robloxia. Under Mr. Mario's leadership, many war crimes were committed by Mushroom Kingdom forces.

From the poster alone, we can see that this movie will show an unrealistic portrayal of life in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Do not buy into the Toadstool lies!
