The Wuhu Island Automotive Safety Organisation (WIASO) has conducted extensive crash testing on vehicles imported from the Mushroom Kingdom. Critically, all cars lack headrests and seatbelts and due to being open top, results in the driver being flung from the vehicle. All the cars tested except for the Wild Wing lacked a sufficient crumple zone, with the Mini Beast crushing the driver's legs even in low speed collisions, and lacking any pedestrian safety at all. The Honey coupe's low sides combined with the high seat of the driver may result in the driver being thrown out of the vehicle when cornering sharply. The Honey coupe also has a razor sharp rear wing which has potential to decapitate the driver in a crash. The Piranha Prowler and Flame Flyer are extremely dangerous to drive due to poor visibility.

WIASO has issued a statement advising against the purchase of these imports as they are high speed death traps of questionable quality. WIASO acknowledges however, that with the inclusion of a seatbelt, the Wild Wing is an acceptably safe car as it has a crumple zone and is reinforced with bars which will help in a side-impact accident.
