Earlier today, Bowser, a descendant of the former Koopa Kings, delivered a well-received speech to a crowd of workers at the Block Forts Park.

In his speech Bowser presented a radical political vision for the future of the Mushroom Kingdom known as "Bowser Revolution", outlined in his recently published book titled "The Bowser Revolution: A Path to Equity and Liberation".

Bowser's ideas pose a potential threat to the Toadstool regime, explicitly calling on Princess Peach to renounce her position and abolish the monarchy. Furthermore, Bowser expressed his frustration with the political influence held by the industrialists, naming Luigi and Wario as examples.
