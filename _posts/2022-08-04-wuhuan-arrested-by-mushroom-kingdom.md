A Wuhuan citizen has been arrested by the Mushroom Kingdom police at a checkpoint for "spying". The Wuhuan government denies spying on the Mushroom Kingdom and demands that she be released along with Matt who has not been heard from since his arrest.

In spite of the response by Wuhu's Government, Pres. Edgeworth has yet to make a statement in regards to the arrest however the press expect any response to be similar in nature to that of Matt Mii's arrest.
