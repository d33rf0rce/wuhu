Wuhu Island's GDP per capita has surpassed that of the neighbouring Mushroom Kingdom. In a speech made from the bridge of the Presidential Castle, Economics Minister Fred Jones said "While stable, our economy is not what it was back in the late 2000's and early 2010's. Now is the time for the Wuhuan people to work harder than ever before, as we cannot fall into the same situation as our neighbours in the Mushroom Kingdom. We will continue to build new housing and encourage skilled workers to become Wuhuan citizens, and we will create new jobs for all."

The crowd that gathered to listen to Mr Jones' speech cheered as he returned indoors.
