The Mushroom Kingdom Grand Prix is postponed after a bullet bill was launched into the crowd at Luigi's Circuit this morning, killing 8 spectators. Matt, who is wanted by the Mushroom Kingdom and was thought to be in exile, was later arrested by secret police on the Toad Turnpike and is believed to be the perpetrator behind this attack. He may face the death penalty if he is found guilty.

This comes just days after Mushroom Kingdom state media released photos of Princess Peach's inspection of the cars that were to compete in the Grand Prix, alongside US President Joseph Biden and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim-Jong-Un. Reports from the Palace Press inform us that the Princess remains uninjured and was away from the site of the attack.
