Robloxians woke up to the sound of gunfire this morning with social media users beginning to post pictures of street fighting in the crossroads. The Toadstool regime has made no formal declaration of war, yet their soldiers appear to have launched an invasion on Robloxia. Pictured below is a failed Robloxian banzai charge against the Mushroom Kingdom's infantry forces.

This comes after increased rampant aggression from the Mushroom Kingdom against various smaller sovereign states. The Wuhuan Government have condemned the actions of the Toadstool Regime and are preparing to increase defense capabilities incase of a similar attack against WAZ territory. The chief of the WIPFD says that Wuhuan citizens should not travel to the Mushroom Kingdom unless it is "absolutely necessary" and if so, Wuhuans should not travel alone.
