Another shipment of cars from the Mushroom Kingdom arrived today. In protest, Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik, a former asylum seeker who became a Wuhuan citizen last year, announced that he plans to domestically produce cars in limited numbers to combat the imports which are rapidly replacing the outdated cars on the island.

Pictured below is Dr. Eggman's prototype which appears to be based on a Jeep. Economics Minister Fred Jones has said that he may consider providing a grant to the Dr. if he is able to successfully demonstrate the capabilities of his prototype vehicle.
