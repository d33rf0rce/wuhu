US President Joe Biden is visiting Wuhu Island for several days. Earlier today President Edgeworth discussed the possibility of military cooperation with the United States of America with Mr Biden. Once Mr Biden had left the meeting, President Edgeworth issued a warning towards the Mushroom Kingdom. "We have not received any communications from the Mushroom Kingdom in recent weeks regarding Matt's whereabouts. I will again demand once more that Matt be returned to Wuhu Island. The Mushroom Kingdom faces consequences if this does not happen soon."

Just as the press prepared to pack up thinking that Mr Edgeworth had finished; The President said "Due to the failure of the Mushroom Kingdom to communicate with us in this past month, I am immediately banning the import of automobiles from the Mushroom Kingdom."
